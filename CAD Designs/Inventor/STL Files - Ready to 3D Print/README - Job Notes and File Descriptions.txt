--- File List ---
Dome Parts:
102_CompCellScopeDome.stl        : Solid Model of Dome, units mm
103_CompCellScopeStage.stl       : Solid Model of Stage, units mm
104_CompCellScopeBoardHolder.stl : Solid Model of Board Holder, units mm

--- Job Notes ---
Part 102 requires a printer resolution of 100-200um to provide sufficient LED mounting accuracy. We used SLA printer capable of 150um resolution (InterPro Models).
Parts 103 and 104 cna be printed with lower sub-millimeter resolution. We used a U-print 3D printer with accuracy of around 300um with no issues.

All parts are in units of mm.
